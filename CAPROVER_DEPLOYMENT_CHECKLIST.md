- [ ] Wait for PostgreSQL to start successfully

### Step 4: Backend App Configuration
- [ ] Go to `multivendor-backend` app in CapRover dashboard
- [ ] Navigate to "App Configs" tab
- [ ] Add all environment variables from `caprover-env-backend.txt`
- [ ] Set `DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=multivendor_platform.settings_caprover`
- [ ] Go to "App Configs" ‚Üí "Persistent Directories"
- [ ] Add persistent directory: `/app/media`
- [ ] Add persistent directory: `/app/static`
- [ ] Go to "HTTP Settings" tab

- [ ] Enable "Let's Encrypt SSL"
- [ ] Save all changes

### Step 5: Frontend App Configuration
- [ ] Go to `multivendor-frontend` app in CapRover dashboard
- [ ] Navigate to "App Configs" tab
- [ ] Add all environment variables from `caprover-env-frontend.txt`
- [ ] Go to "HTTP Settings" tab
- [ ] Enable "HTTPS" and "Force HTTPS"
- [ ] Add custom domain: `multivendor-frontend.indexo.ir` (or `indexo.ir` if you prefer)
- [ ] Enable "Let's Encrypt SSL"
- [ ] Save all changes

## üîß Post-Deployment Setup

### Step 6: Django Setup
- [ ] Wait for backend app to start (check logs: `caprover apps:logs multivendor-backend`)
- [ ] Run migrations: `caprover apps:exec multivendor-backend --command "python manage.py migrate"`
- [ ] Create superuser: `caprover apps:exec multivendor-backend --command "python manage.py createsuperuser"`
- [ ] Collect static files: `caprover apps:exec multivendor-backend --command "python manage.py collectstatic --noinput"`

### Step 7: SSL Certificate Setup
- [ ] Wait 5-10 minutes for Let's Encrypt certificates to be issued
- [ ] Verify SSL is working for `https://multivendor-frontend.indexo.ir` (or `https://indexo.ir`)
- [ ] Verify SSL is working for `https://multivendor-backend.indexo.ir`

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

### Application Access
- [ ] Frontend loads at `https://multivendor-frontend.indexo.ir` (or `https://indexo.ir`)
- [ ] Backend API accessible at `https://multivendor-backend.indexo.ir/api`
- [ ] Admin panel accessible at `https://multivendor-backend.indexo.ir/admin`
- [ ] Can login to admin panel with superuser account

### Functionality Tests
- [ ] Frontend can communicate with backend API
- [ ] Static files (CSS, JS, images) load correctly
- [ ] Media files (user uploads) work correctly

- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] No server errors in logs

## üîç Troubleshooting Checklist

If something doesn't work, check:

### Backend Issues

### SSL Issues
- [ ] Check if domain DNS is pointing to your VPS
- [ ] Verify domain is added correctly in HTTP Settings
- [ ] Wait longer for Let's Encrypt certificate issuance
- [ ] Check CapRover logs for SSL errors

### Database Issues
