# Cursor Rules for Multivendor Platform

## Project Overview
This is a Django REST API backend with Vue.js frontend for a multivendor e-commerce platform.

## Code Style & Standards

### Python (Django Backend)
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use Django REST Framework conventions
- Prefer class-based views for API endpoints
- Use serializers for data validation
- Include proper docstrings for functions and classes
- Use type hints when possible (Python 3.9+)
- Follow Django naming conventions (models use PascalCase, fields use snake_case)

### JavaScript/Vue.js (Frontend)
- Use ES6+ features
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Use Pinia stores for state management
- Prefer async/await over promises
- Use Vuetify components for UI
- Follow Vue style guide conventions
- Use camelCase for variables and functions
- Use PascalCase for components
- designe should be mobile first
- designe should be RTL
- all UX copys should be Persian.

## File Organization
- Backend: `multivendor_platform/multivendor_platform/`
- Frontend: `multivendor_platform/front_end/`
- Keep related files together
- Use appropriate folder structure for Django apps

## API Design
- RESTful API endpoints
- Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE)
- Include proper error handling and status codes
- Validate input data on both frontend and backend
- Use serializers for API responses

## Security
- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords, secrets)
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use Django's authentication and authorization features
- Implement CSRF protection

## Testing
- Write tests for critical functionality
- Use Django's test framework for backend
- Test API endpoints thoroughly
- Include edge cases in tests

## Performance
- Use database queries efficiently (avoid N+1 queries)
- Use select_related and prefetch_related when needed
- Implement pagination for list endpoints
- Optimize frontend bundle size

## Git & Version Control
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Don't commit sensitive files or credentials

## Documentation
- Update README when adding new features
- Document API endpoints
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep deployment guides updated

## Error Handling
- Handle errors gracefully
- Provide meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Use try-except blocks where necessary

## Code Review Guidelines
- Code should be readable and maintainable
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
