# 🔧 Fix: Delete Button Not Showing

## Problem
The "Run" button for bulk actions (including delete) is hidden on the Product list page at:
https://multivendor-backend.indexo.ir/admin/products/product/

## Cause
The Alpine.js `x-show="action"` binding in the Unfold admin template isn't updating properly when an action is selected from the dropdown.

## Solution Applied ✅

### 1. Created JavaScript Fix
**File:** `static/admin/js/fix_action_button.js`

This JavaScript file:
- Listens for changes on the action select dropdown
- Shows/hides the "Run" button based on selection
- Overrides the broken Alpine.js binding

### 2. Updated ProductAdmin
**File:** `products/admin.py`

Added the JavaScript file to the Media class so it loads on the product list page.

## 🚀 How to Apply the Fix

### Option 1: Collect Static Files (Recommended)
Run this command to copy the new JavaScript file to your static directory:

```bash
# Activate virtual environment
cd C:\Users\F003\Desktop\damirco
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Collect static files
cd multivendor_platform\multivendor_platform
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

### Option 2: Restart Django Server
If running locally:
```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart it
python manage.py runserver
```

### Option 3: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open https://multivendor-backend.indexo.ir/admin/products/product/
2. Press `Ctrl + Shift + Delete` (or `Cmd + Shift + Delete` on Mac)
3. Check "Cached images and files"
4. Click "Clear data"
5. Refresh the page (`Ctrl + F5` for hard refresh)

## 📋 How to Test

1. Go to: https://multivendor-backend.indexo.ir/admin/products/product/

2. Select one or more products (check the checkboxes)

3. In the "Action" dropdown at the bottom, select any action:
   - ✅ Mark as Active
   - ❌ Mark as Inactive
   - 🗑️ Delete selected products

4. The **"Run"** button should now appear! ✅

5. Click "Run" to execute the action

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Before:
```html
<!-- Button was hidden -->
<button x-show="action" style="display: none;">Run</button>
```
❌ Alpine.js `x-show="action"` not working
❌ Button stays hidden even when action selected

### After:
```javascript
// JavaScript listens to select changes
actionSelect.addEventListener('change', function() {
    if (selectedAction) {
        runButton.style.display = 'flex'; // ✅ Show button
    } else {
        runButton.style.display = 'none'; // Hide button
    }
});
```
✅ Button appears when action is selected
✅ Button hides when no action selected

## 🎯 Actions You Can Now Use

Once the button appears, you can:

1. **✅ Mark as Active**
   - Select products → Choose "Mark as Active" → Click "Run"
   - Makes selected products visible on your site

2. **❌ Mark as Inactive**
   - Select products → Choose "Mark as Inactive" → Click "Run"
   - Hides selected products from your site

3. **🗑️ Delete Selected Products**
   - Select products → Choose "Delete selected products" → Click "Run"
   - Django will show a confirmation page
   - Confirm to permanently delete
