# 🛡️ HTML Validation System - Complete Guide

## ✅ What's New

I've added **comprehensive HTML error checking** for every scraping request to ensure you only get valid product pages!

---

## 🔍 Validation Layers

### Layer 1: HTTP Response Validation

#### ✅ Checks:
1. **Content-Type Header**
   - ✅ Must be `text/html`
   - ❌ Rejects `application/json` (API endpoints)
   - ⚠️ Warns on unexpected types

2. **Response Content**
   - ✅ Must have content (not empty)
   - ❌ Rejects responses < 100 bytes
   - 💡 Suggests: "Website might be down or URL is incorrect"

3. **Login/Authentication Check**
   - ✅ Detects `wp-login` redirects
   - ❌ Rejects password-protected pages
   - 💡 Suggests: "Page requires login - scraper cannot access"

4. **Maintenance Mode**
   - ✅ Detects "maintenance" or "coming soon" pages
   - ❌ Rejects temporary unavailable sites
   - 💡 Suggests: "Website temporarily unavailable, try again later"

---

### Layer 2: HTML Structure Validation

#### ✅ Checks:
1. **Valid HTML Tags**
   - ✅ Must have `<html>` tag
   - ❌ Rejects invalid HTML
   - 💡 Suggests: "Page is not valid HTML - URL might be incorrect"

2. **Title Tag**
   - ✅ Should have `<title>` tag
   - ⚠️ Warns if missing (doesn't fail)
   - 💡 Notes: "Might not be a valid product page"

3. **404 Error Detection**
   - ✅ Detects "404 Not Found" in content
   - ❌ Rejects even if HTTP status is 200
   - 💡 Suggests: "Product page doesn't exist - check URL"

4. **500/503 Server Errors**
   - ✅ Detects server error messages
   - ❌ Rejects pages showing errors
   - 💡 Suggests: "Website experiencing issues - try again later"

5. **Access Denied**
   - ✅ Detects "Access Denied" / "Forbidden" messages
   - ❌ Rejects blocked pages
   - 💡 Suggests: "Website blocking access - anti-bot protection"

6. **Content Length**
   - ✅ Checks for reasonable content (>200 chars)
   - ⚠️ Warns on very short pages
   - 💡 Notes: "Might not be a valid product page"

7. **Product Page Indicators**
   - ✅ Looks for product-related classes
   - ✅ Checks for WooCommerce elements
   - ⚠️ Warns if none found (doesn't fail)
   - 💡 Notes: "Doesn't match typical product page structure"

## 📚 Related Systems

### Works With:
1. **Robust Error Handling** - categorizes validation errors
2. **Proxy Bypass** - validates after connection
3. **SSL Recovery** - validates after retry
4. **Batch Scraper** - validates all URLs
5. **Progress Tracking** - shows validation failures

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Q: Why did my URL fail validation?
**A**: Check the error message in the scrape job details. It will tell you exactly why (404, login required, etc.)

### Q: Can I disable validation?
**A**: No - it's a core feature that ensures data quality. Fix the URL instead.

### Q: URL works in browser but fails in scraper?
**A**: Could be:
- Page requires login (check error message)
- JavaScript-rendered content (scraper gets raw HTML)
- Anti-bot detection (see error details)

### Q: Getting too many warnings?
**A**: Warnings don't stop scraping! Products are still created. Review them manually if needed.
