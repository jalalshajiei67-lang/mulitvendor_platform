# 🔍 How to View Scraper Error Messages

## UPDATED! Errors Now Show in List View

I've just updated the admin interface to show error messages directly in the scrape jobs list!

## Quick Steps to See Your Error:

### Step 1: Refresh the Admin Page
1. Go to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/products/productscrapejob/
2. **Press Ctrl+F5** (or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac) to hard refresh

### Step 2: Look at the Status Column
You'll now see:
- **Green "COMPLETED"** for successful jobs with ✓ mark
- **Red "FAILED"** for failed jobs
- **Error message shown directly below the status!**

Example of what you'll see:
```
FAILED
Error: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden
```

or

```
FAILED
Error: Failed to fetch page: Connection timeout
```

### Step 3: Click on Job for Full Details
1. Click on the job **ID** number (leftmost column)
2. Scroll to the **"Results"** section
3. You'll see:
   - **Error message**: Full error details
   - **Scraped data**: JSON of what was extracted (if any)
   - **Status**: Current status
   - **Timestamps**: When it was created/processed

## For Your dmabna.com URL

### Your specific URL:
```
https://dmabna.com/product/آماده-سازی-گرانول-ساز-عمودی/
```

### Possible Issues & Quick Fixes:

#### 1. **403 Forbidden Error**
- The website (dmabna.com) might be blocking automated requests
- **Solution**: This is common with Persian websites that have security
- **Try**: Retry the job (it sometimes works on 2nd attempt)

#### 2. **Connection/Timeout Error**
- Website might be slow or temporarily down
- **Solution**: Wait a few minutes and retry

#### 3. **No Price Found (Not an Error!)**
- The page shows "اطلاعات بیشتر" (more information) instead of a price
- **Solution**: This is normal! Product will be created with price = 0.00
- You can manually add the price later

## Common dmabna.com Issues:

Since dmabna.com is a Persian WordPress site, here are specific things to check:

### ✅ What Should Work:
- Product name extraction (in Persian)
- Description extraction (in Persian)
- Image extraction
- Category extraction

### ⚠️ What Might Be Missing:
- **Price**: Page says "اطلاعات بیشتر" (contact for info)
  - This is normal! Price will be 0.00
