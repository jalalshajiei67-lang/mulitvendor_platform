## 🔧 How to Handle Failures

### When You See Failed Jobs:

**Step 1**: Read the error message in report
```
Examples:
- "DNS Resolution Error" → Check internet/URL
- "404 Not Found" → URL doesn't exist
- "Access Denied" → Site blocking
```

**Step 2**: Decide action
```
- If retriable (connection/SSL) → Click "Retry Failed"
- If URL invalid (404) → Fix URL and create new job
- If blocked (403) → Manual creation needed
```

**Step 3**: Retry or fix
```
- Retry button → Auto retries failed jobs
- Or manually edit job and retry
- Or manually create product
```
