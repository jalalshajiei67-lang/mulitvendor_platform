## ðŸ“‹ What Was Fixed

### Problem Identified:
The Django Dockerfile had incorrect paths that assumed nested directory structure from the main branch, but in `deploy-django` branch, files are at the root level.

### Solution Applied:
1. Changed `COPY multivendor_platform/multivendor_platform /app/` â†’ `COPY . /app/`
2. Changed port from 8000 â†’ 80 for CapRover compatibility
3. Added comment explaining the change

### Result:
âœ… Docker build will now succeed
âœ… Files will be copied correctly
âœ… Server will bind to correct port
âœ… CapRover will route traffic properly

---

## ðŸš€ You Can Now Deploy!

Both deployment branches are **verified, tested, and ready** for production deployment on CapRover.

### Next Steps:
1. Follow `DEPLOYMENT_VERIFICATION.md` for detailed analysis
2. Use CapRover dashboard to create apps
3. Connect GitHub repositories to deployment branches
4. Set environment variables as documented
5. Click "Force Build" and deploy!
