## 🖥️ After Deployment - Server Setup

Once deployed to your server, run these commands:

### 1. Collect Static Files (Important!)
```bash
# SSH into your server
ssh root@158.255.74.123

# Navigate to app directory
cd /var/app/multivendor_platform

# Collect static files
python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

**Or if using Docker/CapRover:**
```bash
# Get container ID
docker ps | grep multivendor

# Run collectstatic in container
docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
```

### 2. Restart Server
```bash
# If using systemd
sudo systemctl restart multivendor

# If using Docker
docker restart CONTAINER_NAME

# If using CapRover
# It should auto-restart after deployment
```

---

## ✅ Verification After Deploy

### 1. Check Scraper Works
Visit: https://multivendor-backend.indexo.ir/admin/products/productscrapejob/add-scrape-jobs/

Test with one of your URLs:
```
https://fisheriestech.com/product/automatic-fish-sorting-machine/
```

Expected: ✅ Should scrape successfully!

### 2. Check Delete Button Works
1. Visit: https://multivendor-backend.indexo.ir/admin/products/product/
2. Select a product (checkbox)
3. Choose "Delete selected products"
4. **"Run" button should appear** ✅
5. Clear browser cache if needed (`Ctrl + Shift + Delete`)

### 3. Check Static Files Loaded
1. Open: https://multivendor-backend.indexo.ir/admin/products/product/
2. Press `F12` (Developer Tools)
3. Network tab → Refresh
4. Look for: `fix_action_button.js` (status 200) ✅

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Changes not visible after deploy

**Solution 1: Clear Browser Cache**
```
Press Ctrl + Shift + Delete
Clear "Cached images and files"
Hard refresh: Ctrl + F5
```

**Solution 2: Collect Static Files**
```bash
# On server
python manage.py collectstatic --clear --noinput
```

**Solution 3: Restart Server**
```bash
# Restart the Django/Docker container
sudo systemctl restart multivendor
# or
docker restart CONTAINER_NAME
```

### Issue: Static files not loading

**Check STATIC_ROOT:**
```python
# In settings.py
STATIC_ROOT = os.path.join(BASE_DIR, 'staticfiles')
STATIC_URL = '/static/'
```

**Verify nginx config:**
```nginx
location /static/ {
    alias /var/app/staticfiles/;
}
```

### Issue: Delete button still not showing

**Solution:**
1. Verify `fix_action_button.js` is in static files
2. Run `collectstatic` on server
3. Clear browser cache completely
4. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console)
