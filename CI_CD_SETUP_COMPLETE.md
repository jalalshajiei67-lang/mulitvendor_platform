## 🚀 Using Your CI/CD Pipeline

### Option 1: Push to Main (Auto-Deploy)

```bash
# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
git push origin main

# GitHub Actions will automatically:
# 1. Run all tests
# 2. Check code quality
# 3. Deploy to CapRover
# 4. Run migrations
# 5. Collect static files
```

### Option 2: Create Pull Request (Test Only)

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/new-feature

# Make your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add new feature"
git push origin feature/new-feature

# On GitHub: Create Pull Request
# GitHub Actions will run tests but NOT deploy
```

### Option 3: Manual Deployment

Go to GitHub → **Actions** → **Deploy to CapRover** → **Run workflow**

## 🔍 Workflow Details

### CI Workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `develop`
- Pull requests to `main` or `develop`

**Jobs:**
1. **Backend Tests**
   - Sets up Python 3.11
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs Django tests with PostgreSQL
   - Generates coverage report (minimum 80%)
   - Checks for missing migrations

2. **Frontend Linting**
   - Sets up Node.js 20
   - Installs dependencies
   - Runs ESLint
   - Builds frontend

**Duration:** ~3-5 minutes

### Deploy Workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy-caprover.yml`)

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` branch only
- Manual trigger via GitHub UI

**Jobs:**
1. **Deploy Backend**
   - Creates tarball excluding unnecessary files
   - Deploys to CapRover backend app
   - Runs database migrations
   - Collects static files

2. **Deploy Frontend**
   - Creates tarball for frontend
   - Deploys to CapRover frontend app
   - Waits for backend to finish first

3. **Deployment Summary**
   - Shows deployment status
   - Displays URLs for frontend/backend

**Duration:** ~5-10 minutes

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Tests Failing Locally?

```bash
# Run tests locally
cd multivendor_platform/multivendor_platform
python manage.py test --verbosity=2

# Check specific app
python manage.py test products --verbosity=2

# Run with coverage
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
```

### Deployment Failing?

**Check CapRover Apps:**
```bash
caprover apps:list
caprover apps:logs multivendor-backend
```

**Verify Secrets:**
- Go to GitHub → Settings → Secrets → Actions
- Verify all 4 secrets are set correctly

**Common Issues:**
1. **CapRover password incorrect** → Update `CAPROVER_PASSWORD` secret
2. **App name wrong** → Check app names match exactly
3. **CapRover URL wrong** → Should be `https://captain.indexo.ir`

### Coverage Below 80%?

```bash
# Run coverage report locally
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report --show-missing

# See which files need more tests
coverage html
# Open htmlcov/index.html
```

**Add more tests to:**
- Models that lack tests
- Views/API endpoints
- Business logic functions

## 📝 Customizing Your Pipeline

### Change Coverage Threshold

Edit `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
# Line ~68
coverage report --fail-under=80  # Change 80 to your threshold
```

### Add More Checks

```yaml
# Add to .github/workflows/ci.yml
- name: Check Python code style
  run: |
    pip install black
    black --check .
```

### Add Slack/Discord Notifications

```yaml
# Add at end of deploy-caprover.yml
- name: Notify Slack
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: ${{ job.status }}
    webhook_url: ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }}
```

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Recommended Actions

1. ✅ **Push to GitHub** - Trigger your first CI/CD run
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. ✅ **Watch the Magic** - Go to Actions tab and watch it run

3. ✅ **Check Deployment** - Visit your sites:
   - Frontend: https://indexo.ir
   - Backend: https://backend.indexo.ir/api
   - Admin: https://backend.indexo.ir/admin

4. ✅ **Set Up Branch Protection** (Optional but recommended):
   - Go to Repository → Settings → Branches
   - Add rule for `main` branch
   - Require status checks to pass before merging
   - Require pull request reviews

5. ✅ **Add More Tests** - Improve coverage over time
