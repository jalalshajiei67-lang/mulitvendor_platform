## 💡 Usage Tips

### For Iranian Sites
Most Iranian sites have SSL issues, so the scraper automatically:
- Tries without SSL verification
- Bypasses proxy
- Handles Persian encoding

### For International Sites
The scraper automatically:
- Detects platform (WooCommerce, Shopify, etc.)
- Uses appropriate selectors
- Falls back to generic methods

### Error Messages
Now user-friendly:
- ❌ "404 Page Not Found" → Check URL
- ❌ "Access Forbidden" → Site blocks bots
- ❌ "Timeout" → Site slow, retry later
- ✅ "Completed with warnings" → Check details
