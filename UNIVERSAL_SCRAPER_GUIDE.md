## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Platform Detection
The scraper automatically detects the platform:
```python
# Detects: woocommerce, shopify, magento, custom, etc.
platform = scraper._detect_platform()
```

### 2. Multi-Strategy Extraction

#### Product Name Extraction:
1. **Schema.org structured data** (JSON-LD)
2. **Open Graph** meta tags
3. **Platform-specific** selectors (h1.product_title for WooCommerce)
4. **Generic selectors** (any h1 with "product" in class)
5. **Fallback** to page title

#### Description Extraction:
1. **Schema.org** product description
2. **Open Graph** description
3. **Platform-specific** selectors
4. **Content block analysis** (finds largest meaningful text)
5. **Fallback** to meta description

#### Price Extraction:
1. **Schema.org** price field
2. **Meta tags** (product:price:amount)
3. **Platform-specific** price selectors
4. **Generic** price selectors
5. **Pattern matching** (finds numbers with currency)

#### Image Extraction:
1. **Schema.org** image URLs
2. **Open Graph** image
3. **Platform-specific** gallery selectors
4. **Generic** product image selectors
5. **Lazy-load** attribute handling

## 🚀 How to Use

### Option 1: Through Django Admin (Recommended)
1. Go to Django Admin → Products → Product Scrape Jobs
2. Click "🚀 Batch Scraper"
3. Add URLs (from ANY platform now!)
4. Click "Start Scraping"
5. Watch real-time progress
6. View automatic report

**The system automatically uses the new Universal Scraper!**

### Option 2: Test Failed URLs
Run the test script to verify all your failed URLs now work:

```bash
# Windows
test_scraper_now.bat

# Or manually:
cd multivendor_platform\multivendor_platform
python test_universal_scraper.py
```

This will:
- Test all 9 previously failed URLs
- Show success/failure for each
- Display extracted data (name, price, images)
- Generate detailed report: `scraper_test_results.txt`

### Option 3: Programmatic Usage
```python
from products.universal_scraper import UniversalProductScraper

# Scrape any product URL
scraper = UniversalProductScraper(
    url="https://any-site.com/product/...",
    verify_ssl=False,  # For sites with SSL issues
    use_proxy=False    # Bypass proxy for Iranian sites
)

data = scraper.scrape()

print(f"Product: {data['name']}")
print(f"Platform: {data['platform']}")
print(f"Price: {data['price']}")
print(f"Images: {len(data['images'])}")
print(f"Description: {data['description'][:100]}...")
```

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

### 1. For Iranian Sites:
```python
verify_ssl=False  # Many Iranian sites have SSL issues
use_proxy=False   # Bypass proxy for direct connection
```

### 2. For International Sites:
```python
verify_ssl=True   # Keep SSL verification on
use_proxy=False   # Usually don't need proxy
```

### 3. Retry Strategy:
The system automatically tries 4 combinations:
1. SSL verified, no proxy
2. SSL disabled, no proxy (best for Iranian sites)
3. SSL verified, with proxy
4. SSL disabled, with proxy

### 4. Platform Detection:
The scraper automatically detects:
- **WooCommerce** → Looks for `.woocommerce` classes
- **Shopify** → Looks for Shopify meta tags
- **Custom** → Uses intelligent content analysis

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If a URL still fails:

1. **Check the error message** - now user-friendly:
   - "404 Page Not Found" → URL incorrect
   - "Access Forbidden" → Site blocks bots
   - "SSL Certificate Error" → Try verify_ssl=False
   - "Timeout" → Site slow, try again

2. **Check platform detection:**
   ```python
   print(scraper.platform)  # Shows detected platform
   ```

3. **Check extracted data:**
   ```python
   print(data['scraping_metadata']['summary'])
   ```

4. **Manual inspection:**
   - Open URL in browser
   - Check if it's a valid product page
   - Check if it requires login
   - Check if it has anti-bot protection

### Common Issues:

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "SSL Error" | Use `verify_ssl=False` |
| "Timeout" | Site is slow, retry later |
| "404 Not Found" | Check URL is correct |
| "Access Denied" | Site blocks bots |
| "No description" | Site structure unusual, product still created |
